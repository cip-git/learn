 * Sender and Receiver represent tasks that need to communicate

 * must be associated with a PipedWriter in the constructor.
 * The Sender puts data into the Writer and sleeps for a random amount
 * of time. However, Receiver has no sleep( ) or wait( ).
 * But when it does a read( ), the pipe automatically blocks when
 * there is no more data.
