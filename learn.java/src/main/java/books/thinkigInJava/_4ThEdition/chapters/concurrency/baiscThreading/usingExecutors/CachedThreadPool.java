/**
 * An executorService is a Executor with a service lifecycle
 *
 *
 * With the FixedThreadPool, you do expensive thread allocation once,
 * up front, and you thus limit the number of threads.
 * This saves time because you aren’t constantly paying for thread creation
 * overhead for every single task.
 * Also, in an event-driven system, event handlers that require threads can be
 * serviced as quickly as you want by simply fetching threads from the pool.
 * You don’t overrun the available utils.resources because the FixedThreadPool uses a
 * bounded number of Thread objects
 *
 *
 * Run tasks with SingleThreadExecutor to ensure that only one task
 * at a time is running from any thread
