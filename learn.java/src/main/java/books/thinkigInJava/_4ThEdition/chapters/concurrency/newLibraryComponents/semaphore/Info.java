/**
 * A normal lock (from concurrent.locks or the built-in synchronized lock)
 * only allows one task at a time to access a resource.
 * A counting semaphore allows n tasks to access the resource at
 * the same time. You can also think of a semaphore as handing out
 * "permits" to use a resource, although no actual permit objects are used.
