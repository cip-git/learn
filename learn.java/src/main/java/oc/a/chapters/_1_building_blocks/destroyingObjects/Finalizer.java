 * Java allows objects to implement a method called finalize() that might get
 * called. This method gets called if the garbage collector tries to collect the
 * object. If the garbage collector doesn�t run, the method doesn�t get called.
 * If the garbage collector fails to collect the object and tries to run it
 * again later, the method doesn�t get called a second time.
