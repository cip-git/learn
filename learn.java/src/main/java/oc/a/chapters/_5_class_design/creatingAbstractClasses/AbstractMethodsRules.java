 * 1. Abstract interfaceMethods may only be defined in abstract classes.

 * 2. Abstract interfaceMethods may not be declared private or final.
 * 
 * 3. Abstract interfaceMethods must not provide a method body/implementation in the
 * abstract class for which is it declared.
 * 
 * 4. Implementing an abstract method in a subclass follows the same rules for
 * overriding a method. For example, the dishName and signature must be the same,
 * and the visibility of the method in the subclass must be at least as
 * accessible as the method in the parent class.
