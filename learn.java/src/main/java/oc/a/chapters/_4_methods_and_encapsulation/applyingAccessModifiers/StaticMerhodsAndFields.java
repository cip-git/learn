/**
 * Each class has a copy of the dbInstance variables. There is only one copy of
 * the code for the dbInstance interfaceMethods. Each dbInstance of the class can call it as
 * many times as it would like. However, each call of an dbInstance method (or any
 * method) gets space on the stack for method parameters and local variables.
 * 

 * The same thing happens for static interfaceMethods. There is one copy of the code.
 * Parameters and local variables go on the stack.
 * 
 * 
 * Just remember that only data gets its �own copy.� There is no need to
 * duplicate copies of the code itself.
