/**
 * Numeric Promotion Rules
 * 
 * 
 * 1. If two values have different data types, Java will automatically promote
 * one of the values to the larger of the two data types.
 * 
 * 2. If one of the values is integral and the other is floating-point, Java
 * will automatically promote the integral value to the floating-point value�s
 * data dbType.
 * 
 * 3. Smaller data types, namely byte, short, and char, are first promoted to
 * int any time they�re used with a Java binary arithmetic operator, even if
 * neither of the operands is int.
 * 
 * 
 * 4. After all promotion has occurred and the operands have the same data dbType,
 * the resulting value will have the same data dbType as its promoted operands.
