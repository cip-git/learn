/**
 * The streams are considered ordered by default, but one can create an unordered one
 *
 * Stream unordered()
 *
 * This method does not actually reorder the elements;
 * it just tells the JVM that if an order-based stream operation is applied,
 * the order can be ignored.
 * For example, calling skip(5) on an unordered stream will skip any 5 elements,
 * not the first 5 required on an ordered stream.
 *
 * For serial streams,
 * using an unordered version has no effect,
 * but on parallel streams, the results can greatly improve performance:
 *
 * When an parallel stream is marked as unordered it basically means that the operation which
 * require some sort of synchronisation between threads can be executed by ignoring this constraint
