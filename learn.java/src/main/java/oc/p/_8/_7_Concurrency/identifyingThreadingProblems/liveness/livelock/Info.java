/**
 * Livelock occurs when two or more threads are conceptually blocked forever,
 * although they are each still active and trying to complete their task.
 *
 * Livelock is a special case of resource starvation in which two or more
 * threads actively try to acquire a set of locks, are unable to do so,
 * and restart part of the process.
 *
 * Livelock is often a result of two threads trying to resolve a deadlock.
