/**
 * Once you have finished using a thread executor,
 * it is important that you call the shutdown() method.
 *
 * A thread executor creates a non-daemon thread on the first task that is executed,
 * so failing to call shutdown() will result in your application never terminating.
 *
 * The executorService interface does not implement AutoCloseable,
 * so you cannot use a try-with-resources statement.
 *
 * One can still use a finally block.
 * While not required, it is considered a good practice to do so.
